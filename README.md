# RESTful-Web-Services-and-JPA
Certainly! The project involves the development and deployment of a RESTful Web Service using Spring Boot. The application interacts with an Amazon RDS database named 'UniSurvey,' specifically with a 'survey' table for storing survey data.
The entire setup, including code, Docker containerization, and Kubernetes deployment, is managed through a GitHub repository. Jenkins automation is employed for seamless integration and deployment, ensuring the successful hosting of the application on a Rancher Kubernetes cluster. 
The functionality of the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) is demonstrated using Postman. Overall, the project showcases a complete lifecycle, from development to deployment, of a containerized Spring Boot application with a focus on Kubernetes orchestration.
